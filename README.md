# **Image-based food recognition** with U-Nets 
The repository contains the project realized for the *Deep Learning* course of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence), at Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna.

The projects is realized by:
* Alex Costanzino ([arcanoXII](https://github.com/arcanoXIII)), alex.costanzino@studio.unibo.it;
* Marco Costante ([Markostante](https://github.com/Markostante)), marco.costante@studio.unibo.it.

## Contents
* `01_dimension_check.py` and `02_reordering_dataset.py` are just auxiliary tools to pre-process the dataset;
* `u_net_for_image-based_food_segmentation.ipynb` is the main notebook;
* `evaluation-demo.ipynb` is a notebook for quick evaluation of the various models.

## Main libraries
* Tensorflow with Keras backend;
* Numpy;
* Pandas;
* OpenCV;
* PIL;
* pycocotools;
* tqdm;
* matplotlib;
* segmentation_models.

Further details can be found in the report.
