# **Image-based food recognition with U-Nets** 

The repository contains the project realized for the *Deep Learning* course of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence), at Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna.

The *Food Recognition* challenge is a competition hosted by [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/food-recognition-challenge), where participants should deal with an image segmentation problem aiming to recognize individual food items in each image.

The **goal** of this challenge is to train models which can look at images of food items and detect the individual food items present in them.
